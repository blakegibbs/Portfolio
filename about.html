                <p>I am Blake, Iâ€™m 20 years old and currently live in Derbyshire. I began learning game development using scratch when I was 5 years old. Around the age of 14 I started using Unity to develop my first games, learn C# and the principles of object-oriented programming. At college I studied computer science which honed in my understanding of computers and improved my python skills all the while still working with Unity in my spare time.</p>
                <p>Since then I have been studying games development programming at Falmouth University. While earning my degree I have also learnt Unreal engine and C++. I prefer developing and programming gameplay mechanics and AI however am generally open to any challenge.</p>
                <p>Outside of game development I spend a lot of my free time skateboarding, listening to music and going camping when the weather permits me to.</p>

                <h6>Unity engine programmer & developer</h6>
                <p>I have around seven years of personal experience with C# and Unity. Primarily focusing on gameplay programming and AI, where I've developed boss fights, enemies, animal behaviours, character controllers and custom ammunition systems. I also have well rounded skills across most areas of Unity.</p>

                <h3>Programming C++</h3>
                <h6>Unreal engine C++</h6>
                <p>Since starting university I have had a keen interest in learning C++ and Unreal engine, I have around a years personal experience using this and am constantly looking to improve my skills. In Unreal so far my focus has been on AI where I have programmed a state machine for a boss/enemy and worked with boids and procedural animation. I also have a decent understanding of blueprints however I am keen in sticking to C++.</p>

                <h3>Python, HTML, CSS & SQL</h3>
                <h6>Side projects and other languages</h6>
                <p>I have also learnt some other languages as a part of my education or through experiments with code in my free time. Python has been a strong language of mine since I started learning to code. I have used it to create games, analyse data and create a Duolingo clone as a side project during university, this also exposed me to databases and SQL which I used for the language translation of this console app.</p>
                <p>My experience with HTML and CSS began in college with a web development module, I have since continued to practice this on occasion and used those skills to develop this website.</p>
